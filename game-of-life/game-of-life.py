#Rules of the game:
#Consider a single cell 
#   1. If cell is alive and number of neighbours alive is 2 or 3, cell continues to remain alive in the next iteration
#   2. If cell is dead and exactly 3 neighbours are alive, cell is revived in the next iteration
#   3. Remaining cells that are alive will die (and dead cells will remain dead) in the next iteration

# Steps:
#   1. Create a class that has all the information and methods required to implement the rules of the game:
#       - Number of rows
#       - Number of columns
#       - Method to set the initial configuration of the cells and the configuration after every iteration
#           * In this method, we have to locate the 8 neighbours surrounding a specific cell
#           ! Formula to locate a cell's 8 neighbours (assuming there are l columns and h rows, and id of cell is n):
#               - T: n - l
#               - B: n + l
#               - L: n - 1
#               - R: n + 1
#               - TR: n - (l - 1)
#               - TL: n - (l + 1)
#               - BR: n + (l + 1)
#               - BL: n + (l - 1)
#               - Edge cases: check if the id of the neighbour is >= 0 and <= l * h - 1 (in order to see if it actually exists; corner cells might miss some neighbours)
#               - View formula-1.jpg and formula-2.jpg to see how I arrived at the formula
#           * Once located, we have to determine whether the cell should be dead or alive in the next iteration
#           ? How do we configure the initial state, when the game first starts. 
#           ? Do we assume that all of the cells are dead/alive? 
#           ? Or do we use use a random function to determine the initial state of each cell? 
#           ? Does this even matter in the first place?
