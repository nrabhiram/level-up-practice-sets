#Rules of the game:
#Consider a single cell 
#   1. If cell is alive and number of neighbours alive is 2 or 3, cell continues to remain alive in the next iteration
#   2. If cell is dead and exactly 3 neighbours are alive, cell is revived in the next iteration
#   3. Remaining cells that are alive will die (and dead cells will remain dead) in the next iteration
